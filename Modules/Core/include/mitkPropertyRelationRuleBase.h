  /**Base class to standardize/abstract/encapsulate rules and business logic to detect and define
  (property/data based) relations in MITK.
  Following important definitions must be regarded when using/implementing/specifing rule classes:
  - Releations represented by rules are directed relations that point from a source IPropertyOwner (Source)
  to a destination IPropertyOwner (Destination).
  - Rule can be abstract (indicated by IsAbstract()) or concrete. Abstract rules cannot be used to connect relations.
  Abstract rules can only be used to detect/indicate or disconnect relations. Therefore, in contrast to concrete rules,
  abstract rules can be used to indicate several relations that are established be "derived" rules. See e.g. GenericIDRelationRule:
  in its abstract state it cannot connect but be used to detect any type of generic ID relation.
  - A concrete rule ID (rule ID of a concrete rule) always "implements" a concrete relation type. E.g. In DICOM the
  way to express the source image relation to an input image and to a mask would be nearly the same
  and only differs by the encoded purpose. One may implement an interim or joined class that manages the mutual
  stuff, but the registered instances must be one concrete rule for "DICOM source input image" and one concrete rule for
  "DICOM source mask" and both rules must have distinct rule IDs.
  - Source may have several relations of a rule to different Destinations.
  Destination may have several relations of a rule from different Sources. But a specific source destination
  pair may have only one relation of a specific rule id (concrete rule). A specific source destination
  pair may however have multiple relations for an abstract rule.
  - The deletion of a Destination in the storage does not remove the relation implicitly. It becomes a "zombie" relation
  but it should still be documented, even if the destination is unknown. One has to explicitly
  disconnect a zombie relation to get rid of it.
  - Each relation has its own UID (relationUID) that can be used to address it.

  The basic concept of the rule design is that we have two layers of relation identification: Layer 1 is the ID-layer
  which uses the IIdentifiable interface and UIDs if available to encode "hard" relations. Layer 2 is the Data-layer
  which uses the properties of Source and Destination to deduce if there is a relation of the rule type.
  The ID-layer is completely implemented by this base class. The base class only falls back to the Data-layer
  (implemented by the concrete rule class) if the ID-layer is not sufficient or it is explicitly stated.
  Reasons for the introduction of the ID-layer are: 1st, data-defined relations may be weak (several Destinations are
  possible; e.g. DICOM source images may point to several loaded mitk images). But if explicitly a relation was
  connected it should be deduceable. 2nd, checks on a UID are faster then unnecessary data deduction.

  Rules use relation instance identifing (RII) properties in order to manage their relations that are stored in the
  Source. The RII-properties follow the following naming schema:
  "MITK.Relations.<InstanceID>.<RuleID>.[relationUID|destinationUID|ruleID|<data-layer-specific>]"
  - <InstanceID>: The unique index of the relation for the Source. Used to assign/group the properties to
  their relation. In the default implementation of this class the instance id is an positive integer (i>0).
  - relationUID: The UID of the relation. Set by the ID-layer (so by this class)
  - destinationUID: The UID of the Destination. Set by the ID-layer (so by this class) if Destination implements
  IIdentifiable.
  - ruleID: The identifier of the concrete rule that sets the property. Is specified by the derived class and set
  automaticaly be this base class.
  - <data-layer-specific>: Information needed by the Data-layer (so derived classes) to find the relationUID
